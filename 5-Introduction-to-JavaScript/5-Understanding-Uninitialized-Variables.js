/* learned how variables have an initial value of undefined when declared. Mathmatical operations on undefinded variables
result in NaN (not a number), concatenation of a string with an undefined variable will give you a literal string of undefined*/

//initialized var a to 5, b to 10 and c to "I am a"

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line
