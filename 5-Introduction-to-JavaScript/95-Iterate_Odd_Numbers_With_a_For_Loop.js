//learned that for loops don't have to iterate one at a time and can increment by 2 ect...

// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
//set up the for loop to increment by 2 each iteration and to push odd numbers between 1-9 into myArray
var myArray = [];
for(var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}

// Only change code below this line.
