//learned about accessing object properties with bracket notation, this must be used if property name has a space in it, also property name must be in quotes when there is a space

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line
//set entreeValue to equal "an entree" property of testObj
var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
//set drinkValue to equal "the drink" property of testObj
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
