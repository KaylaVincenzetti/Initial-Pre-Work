//learned to insert variables into string by using + operator

//built myStr by concatenating with myName variables
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Kayla";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
