//learned about javascript objects which are similar to arrays but we acces their data by properties not indexes

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
//made an object called mydog
var myDog = {
  "name": "Corbin",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Tuco", "Arjune", "Trishia", "Thor"]




};
