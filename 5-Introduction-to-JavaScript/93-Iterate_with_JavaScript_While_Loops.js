//learned about while loops and how they only run while a specified condition is true and stops running once condition is no longer true

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
//created a while loop to push the numbers 1-4 into myArray
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++
}
