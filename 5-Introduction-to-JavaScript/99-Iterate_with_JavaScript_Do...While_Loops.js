//learned how to create a do while loop which is like a while loop but it will do one pass of the code initially no matter what and then stop once condition is no longer true

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.
do {

  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5)
