//learned about the strict inequality operator which works the same as the strict equality operator but for things that do not have the same value and type

// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
  // Only Change Code Below this Line
  //set strict inequality for val and 17
  if (val !== 17) {

  // Only Change Code Above this Line

    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testStrictNotEqual(10);
