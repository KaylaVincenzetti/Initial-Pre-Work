//learned javascript starts counting at 0 instead of one and how to use bracket notation to find characters at specific indexes of strings

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
//added [0] to find first character of variable last name
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
