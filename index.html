                <h1>About Corbin</h1>
                <p>Corbin, aka, Corbin Dallas, is my best friend.
                    I adopted Corbin from the Buddy Center in January 2014 and he changed my life.
                    He was a 10 month old, wild puppy with NO training and I wanted to be a dog trainer.
                    He broke me, and I no longer want to be a dog trainer. We had to use 5 different trainers to get his behvior undeer control.
                    He is now the most loving and well behaved (most days) dog I've ever had and adopting him was the best decison I ever made.
                    Please use the link to the Buddy Center found at the bottom of the page to find out more about adopting a pet.</p>
